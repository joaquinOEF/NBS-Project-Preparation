# Recommended Datasets for NBS Design

Exploratory inventory for **Porto Alegre (POA)**. Links each candidate dataset to an NBS design decision, following the workflow in [`nbs_dataset_identification_methodology.md`](nbs_dataset_identification_methodology.md).

**Scope:** multi-hazard NBS screening for POA. Tables are organized **by hazard** below. Hazard-specific rationale lives in the lens documents (`flood`, `heat`, `landslide`).

## Hazard index

| Hazard | Lens document | E2E exercise | Tables in this doc |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Flood** | [`flood_nbs_dataset_lens.md`](flood_nbs_dataset_lens.md) | [`nbs_site_query_flood_e2e.md`](nbs_site_query_flood_e2e.md) | Steps 0–6 populated |
| **Heat** | [`heat_nbs_dataset_lens.md`](heat_nbs_dataset_lens.md) | [`nbs_site_query_heat_e2e.md`](nbs_site_query_heat_e2e.md) | Steps 0–6 populated |
| **Landslides** | [`landslide_nbs_dataset_lens.md`](landslide_nbs_dataset_lens.md) | [`nbs_site_query_landslide_e2e.md`](nbs_site_query_landslide_e2e.md) | Steps 0–6 populated |

Use the lens doc for hazard-specific design logic; use this doc for the **dataset inventory tables** (proxy → dataset → gap).

## Shared workflow (Steps 0–6)

Each row in the hazard tables traces one link in this chain:

```text
Step 0  Priority screening     → hazard/risk scores (where to start)
Step 1  Hazard context         → where/why the problem occurs (before choosing NBS)
Step 2  NBS typology           → e.g. rain garden, street trees, slope revegetation
Step 3  Site condition         → Required | Preferred | Exclusion | Uncertainty
Step 4  Geospatial proxy        → measurable spatial concept for that condition
Step 5  Candidate dataset       → data source that represents the proxy
Step 6  Gap / caveat            → what the dataset cannot answer
```

**How to read a row:** for NBS *X*, site condition *Y* needs proxy *Z*; dataset *D* is a candidate to assess it; note the gap.

Step 1 is hazard-specific:

| Hazard | Step 1 question |
|---|---|
| Flood | Where / why does water collect or overflow? |
| Heat | What thermal exposure pattern dominates (UHI, shade deficit, LST, social exposure)? |
| Landslides | What predisposing and triggering factors combine (slope, rain, soil, vegetation, drainage)? |

## Flood

> Detail: [`flood_nbs_dataset_lens.md`](flood_nbs_dataset_lens.md) · Methodology: [`flood_hazard_score_methodology.md`](flood_hazard_score_methodology.md), [`flood_risk_score_methodology.md`](flood_risk_score_methodology.md)

### Step 0 — Priority screening

Flood hazard and risk scores identify **where** to start. They do not indicate **which** NBS fits.

| Hazard | Role | Geospatial proxy | Candidate dataset | Source | Coverage (POA) | Gap / caveat |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Flood | Priority area | Flood susceptibility / hazard intensity | Flood hazard score (`poa_flood_hazard`) | OEF / COUGAR | ~250 m | Screening only; does not indicate NBS type |
| Flood | Priority area | Hazard × exposure × vulnerability | Flood risk score (`poa_flood_risk`) | OEF / COUGAR | ~250 m | Priority ≠ suitability |
| Flood | Exposure context | Population density | Exposure score | IBGE → OEF grid | ~250 m | Constant within bairro |
| Flood | Vulnerability context | Age share (social vulnerability) | Vulnerability score | IBGE → OEF grid | ~250 m | Age-only proxy |
| Flood | Socioeconomic context | Poverty, infrastructure | IBGE neighbourhood indicators | IBGE | vector (bairros) | Census 2010 indicators |
| Flood | Validation context | Observed flood depth | Copernicus EMSN194 (May 2024) | Copernicus EMS | event raster | Event-specific; not primary hazard score |

### Step 1 — Flood mechanism: where / why water collects

Read this **before** the NBS tables below. These rows diagnose the type of flood problem in a priority zone — they apply to **all** water-managing NBS, not one type in particular.

## Landslides

> Detail: [`landslide_nbs_dataset_lens.md`](landslide_nbs_dataset_lens.md) · Methodology: [`landslide_hazard_score_methodology.md`](landslide_hazard_score_methodology.md), [`landslide_risk_score_methodology.md`](landslide_risk_score_methodology.md)

### Step 0 — Priority screening

Landslide hazard and risk scores identify **where** slope stabilization or revegetation screening may start. They do not indicate **which** NBS fits.

| Hazard | Role | Geospatial proxy | Candidate dataset | Source | Coverage (POA) | Gap / caveat |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Landslide | Priority area | Landslide susceptibility ensemble | Landslide hazard score (`poa_landslide_hazard`) | OEF / COUGAR | ~90 m (→ bairro for risk) | Susceptibility index; not failure probability; slope < 15° → H = 0 |
| Landslide | Priority area | Hazard × exposure × vulnerability | Landslide risk score (`poa_landslide_risk`) | OEF / COUGAR | ~90 m; E/V from bairro | Priority ≠ suitability |
| Landslide | Exposure context | Population density | Exposure score | IBGE → OEF grid | burned to 90 m | Constant within bairro; total area denominator |
| Landslide | Vulnerability context | Age share (social vulnerability) | Vulnerability score | IBGE → OEF grid | burned to 90 m | Age-only proxy; no informal housing on slopes |
| Landslide | Validation context | Observed landslide events / inventories | CEMADEN; municipal geohazard maps; event points | civil defense; municipal | vector / point | Often not open; hazard not validated against inventory |

### Step 1 — Landslide susceptibility context: predisposing + triggering factors

These rows diagnose **why** a priority zone may be landslide-prone — they apply to **all** slope-stabilization NBS, not one type in particular. Mirrors the COUGAR hazard ensemble inputs.

|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

| Landslide | *(mechanism)* | Required | Frequent extreme rainfall | R90p precipitation climatology | `chirps_r90p_climatology` | CHC / catalog | ~5 km → 90 m | Gridded; not antecedent rainfall or local gauges |

| Landslide | *(mechanism)* | Required | Low vegetation protection | Persistently low NDVI | MODIS NDVI P10 DJF | NASA / COUGAR | 250 m → 90 m | NDVI ≠ root depth or species |
| Landslide | *(mechanism)* | Required | Drainage convergence / low HAND | Height above nearest drainage | MERIT HAND | MERIT / COUGAR | 90 m | HAND ≠ engineered drainage or pipes |
| Landslide | *(mechanism)* | Preferred | Disturbed or bare slopes | Built/bare on slope | Dynamic World (built, bare); forest cover change | Google/WRI; Hansen | 10 m; 30 m | 2023 vintage; land cover ≠ failure history |
| Landslide | *(mechanism)* | Preferred | Upslope contributing area | Flow accumulation | MERIT UPA | MERIT | 90 m | Urban drainage networks not captured |

## Open data vs gaps (Step 6 summary)

Gaps are listed **by hazard** where they differ; shared gaps appear once under **All hazards**.

### All hazards

| Gap | Affects | Open alternative? | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Land ownership / cadastre | Most ground-based NBS | Partial (OSM parks/roads as proxy) | Legal tenure not inferable from land cover |
| Native species / ecoregions | Vegetation-based NBS | GBIF, ecoregions (incomplete for POA) | Local ecological expertise required |
| Underground utilities | Linear / planting NBS | None open at city scale | Engineering survey required |
| Exposure / vulnerability modifiers | All risk-based prioritization | Shared E/V only | Age-only V; no hazard-specific social layers in catalog |

### Flood

| Gap | Affects | Open alternative? | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Urban drainage network | All urban flood NBS | No good open global layer | Municipal data required |
| Groundwater depth | Infiltration NBS | Global layers too coarse for urban POA | Field or local hydrogeology |
| Local IDF / rain gauges | Sizing bioswales, basins, rain gardens | CHIRPS as screening proxy only | ~5 km gridded |
| Field infiltration tests | All infiltration-based NBS | `soilgrids_clay` as screening proxy | Required before design |
| COUGAR terrain / flood inputs (local only) | Multiple NBS | `poa_slope`, `poa_relative_elevation`, `poa_depression_*`, `gfplain250m`, `jrc_gloflor_v2`, `wri_aqueduct_flood`, `global_flood_database` in catalog | Local exports exist; S3 tiles pending |

### Heat

| Gap | Affects | Open alternative? | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| LST ≠ thermal comfort | All cooling NBS prioritization | None at city scale | Hazard uses surface temperature, not air temp, shade, humidity, wind |
| Pedestrian exposure layers | Street trees, pocket parks, schoolyard greening | OSM streets/schools as weak proxy | No standard map of where people experience outdoor heat |
| Roof suitability / structural capacity | Green roofs, green walls | Built-up layers only | Cannot distinguish roof type, load capacity, existing green roofs |
| Water availability / irrigation | Trees, green roofs, lawns | `soilgrids_clay` + drought indices as weak proxy | Major local constraint in dry periods |
| Microclimate feedback | All vegetation cooling NBS | — | Canopy design and surrounding materials need local assessment |
| Coarse ERA5-Land indices | Regional heatwave context | Catalog indices at ~11 km; `era5_land_heatwave_freq_djf` (COUGAR local) | Excluded from operational heat hazard ensemble |

### Landslides

| Gap | Affects | Open alternative? | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Geotechnical / geology | All slope NBS | Global geology maps too coarse | Site investigations required |
| Landslide event inventory | Validation and calibration | Municipal geohazard maps | Often not open |
| CHIRPS R90p resolution | Trigger context | Nearest resample to 90 m | ~5 km native; honest limit on spatial detail |
